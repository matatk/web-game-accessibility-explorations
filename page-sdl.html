alert(`Demo of game UI accessibility (works with a screen reader)

This demo simulates the UI of a game, which would normally run full-screen, and
take over the keyboard and mouse (however, in this case, the game UI is shown
side-by-side with the proxy accessible UI created for it). Normal screen-reader
shortcut keys won't work, but by using the arrow keys to interact with the
game, you will still find that the UI are announced.

Use the up/down arrow keys to move between menu items.

Use the right arrow key to enter a menu (there's no 'back' function at the
moment).

Use the left/right arrow keys when focused on a slider to adjust the slider.

Type letters/numbers/spaces into a textbox when it has the focus.
