Simple test of a "Hello, world!" C program that also sends its output to a live region, for a screen-reader to announce.

 * Build and run the native executable with `make run-native`
 * Build and serve the HTML version with `make serve`
 * If you just want to build both versions, run `make`

The native version won't interface with a screen-reader, only the HTML one will.
